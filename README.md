# Javascript
Learning Javascript from Chai aur code
This repository contains basic concepts of JavaScript
like comparison operators, data types, primitive and
reference types. Notes are written in simple Hinglish.
## Topics Covered
- Comparison Operators (== vs ===)
- Primitive Data Types
- Reference Data Types
- heap and stach memory

## Comparison in JavaScript
JavaScript provides loose and strict comparison...
### JavaScript String Practice

- Used template literals for string interpolation
- Worked with string objects and properties
- Practiced string methods like charAt, indexOf, slice, substring, trim
- Modified URLs using replace and includes
- Converted strings into arrays using split



**## JavaScript Numbers & Math

- Learned about number primitives and Number objects
- Used number methods like toString, toFixed, toPrecision, and toLocaleString
- Practiced Math object methods (abs, round, ceil, floor, min, max)
- Generated random numbers using Math.random()
- Created random numbers within a fixed range using min–max formula

I learned how to work with the JavaScript Date object. I understood how to create a new date using new Date() and display it in different readable formats like toString(), toDateString(), and toLocaleString(). I also learned how to create custom dates using different formats and understood that months in JavaScript start from zero. Along with this, I explored timestamps using Date.now(), converted milliseconds into seconds, and extracted useful information like month number and day of the week. Finally, I learned how to format dates using toLocaleString() to get the full name of the weekday.

Today I Learned – JavaScript Arrays

An array is created using square brackets [] in JavaScript.

Array elements are accessed using index numbers.

The push() method adds an element at the end of the array.

The pop() method removes the last element of the array.

The unshift() method adds an element at the beginning of the array.

The shift() method removes the first element of the array.

The unshift() method is not recommended because it changes the index of all elements.

The includes() method checks whether an element is present in the array or not.

The join() method converts an array into a string.

The slice() method returns a part of the array without changing the original array.

The splice() method changes the original array and returns the removed elements.
