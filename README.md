I learned how to work with the JavaScript Date object. I understood how to create a new date using new Date() and display it in different readable formats like toString(), toDateString(), and toLocaleString(). I also learned how to create custom dates using different formats and understood that months in JavaScript start from zero. Along with this, I explored timestamps using Date.now(), converted milliseconds into seconds, and extracted useful information like month number and day of the week. Finally, I learned how to format dates using toLocaleString() to get the full name of the weekday.
